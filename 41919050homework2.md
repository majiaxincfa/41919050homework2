                                 WHAT IS CLOUD COMPUTING
  - Cloud computing is the **on-demand availbility of computer system resources**, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence. As the delivery of computing services **over the Internet**, it aims at offering faster innovation,flexible resources, and economies of scale.   
  - The **cost** of cloud computing depends how many services you use,eliminating the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site datacenters. The more resouces you use, the higer cost you will have to pay.
  - As for the **speed**, most cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand,so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few clicks ,giving business a lot of flexibility and taking the pressure off capacity planning.
  - With regard to the **global** scale of cloud computing, the benefits of cloud computing sevices include the ability to scale **elastically**.In cloud speak, that means delivering the right amount of IT resources-for example, more or less computing power,storage,bandwidth-right when they're needed,and from the right geographic location.

  - Cloud computing is also productive because it removes the need for tasks like hardware setup,software patching ,leaving more time for IT teams to work on more important goals.
  - Preformance:The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficent computing hardware.This offers several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, including reduced network latency for apps and greater economies of scale.
  - Reliability: data backup, disaster recovery(data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites)
  - Security: a broad set of policies, technologies, controls.
